		<div id="bg">
			The climate crisis is one of the biggest threats to life on Earth. According to World Health Organization (2021), climate change is expected to fuel the deaths of approximately 250 000 people every year from many reasons including heat stress, malnutrition, malaria, and diarrhea. The people who are most vulnerable to these effects are the people who contribute the least to this growing problem. This includes low-income households and communities. 
			<br><br>
			The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that the world must keep temperature rise to 1.5°C or less to avoid disastrous health effects and millions of deaths caused by climate change. Due to what people have done in the past, a certain amount of global warming and other changes to the climate are already set in stone. Even a warming of 1.5°C is not safe, though, because every extra tenth of a degree will have a serious effect on people's lives and health.

			This environmental crisis affects all of us in various different ways, but in general, these effects have been harmful to everyday life. To name a few, we have the heating of the globe, also known as global warming. Global warming has resulted to events such as the melting of icecaps, which has ruined the habitat of many animals including polar bears and penguins. It also results to forest fires and more frequent and severe droughts. 
			<br><br>
			This also resulted to the destruction of animal habitats and unhealthy living conditions for humans. The excess amounts of plastic and other waste end up in landfills, incinerators, and in our oceans.  It also results to higher prices as there will be less resources in circulation, but the demand stays the same or becomes bigger.
